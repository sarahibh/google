        <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1> 

        <p>Really, it is.</p> 

        <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some <br /> styling?</h2>

        <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <br /><span class="color">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put your damn footer as a link. <br />You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

        <p>WRONG, motherfucker.</p>

        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        
        <p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mf">motherfuckingwebsites</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/"><span class="color">Google home page</span></a></li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
            <li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, kind of</li> 
            <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it (but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible)</li>
            <li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style <br /> 
                without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
            <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
            <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
            <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or<br />any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
            <li>Doesn't include any tracking service this website does, but hey, who cares</li>
            <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em>JUST USE IT</em>.</li>
            <li>Use <em>some</em> fucking colors.</li>
            <li>Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="vv">violetish color</span><br />when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

        <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.</p>
        Why ? 

        <ul>
            <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be <br />different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
            <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
            <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
            <li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
            <li>It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
            <li>It uses  <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <strong>/s</strong></li>
            <li>It doesn't use a single media query well, not really </li>
            <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is <br />outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a> </li>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript , CSS3  and HTML5  </li>
            <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
            <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the <br />website more than once</li>
            <li>It uses <a href="https://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
            <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
            <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a></li>
            <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
            <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you<br />can and what you can't do:</li>

                0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
        </ul>

        <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>

        Yeah, a ... <strong>#444 is cool</strong> but a ... <strong>#454545 is better</strong>.<br />We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a motherfuckingwebsite. 

        <h2>Siza matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>

        <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27<br />inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

        <h2>Put some pictures</h2>

        <p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a 
        motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a 
        context.</p>

        <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it 
        should make the user happy while reading your nonsense 
        words.</p><br />You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.

        A cat, just to keep the context of the website.

        <h2>Yes, even this is satire</h2>

        <p>But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations, instead keep it<br />simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>

        Good design is as little design as possible.
        Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com<br />That's not entirely true, look at that motherfuckingwebsite. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>

        <p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite</a> and the<a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><br />bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>.</p>

        <p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even<br />though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.</p>

        Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" Cit. needed

        <h2>Author</h2>

        <p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali">be followed on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/">followed on GitHub</a> or<br />contacted <a href="https://denv.it/">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a></p>

        <h2>resources</h2>

        <p>The cat picture was taken from the cool <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka<br />Public Domain) content. The author is <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/1899441-1899441/">1899441</a> (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old<br />picture</a> was by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt</a>, but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute. You can <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/issues/new">open an<br />issue on GitHub</a>if you think that this decision goes against the rules of a good looking<br />motherfuckingwebsite. </p>
